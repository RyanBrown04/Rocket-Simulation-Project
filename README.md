# Rocket Simulation Project
This project is a vertical rocket simulation written in python, for my ENAE380 class. It uses real physics, and allows for users to choose between preset rockets to launch or to customize their own. It handles mass changes, thrust curves, drag, chute deployment, and descent. The sim outputs flight parameters and data, and create a real-time graph to represent altitude.
